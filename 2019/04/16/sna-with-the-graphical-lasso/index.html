<p>Imagine you’re a financial advisor that has access to transactional data from the accounts of several thousand individuals, for example, one year of daily transactions from across 100k people who have been investing in the stock market. You have a finite budget for marketing your services and would like to expend the least amount possible on marketing while effectively reaching the greatest number of potential clients. A tool that reveals the social network structure of potential clients is incredibly useful for maximizing the efficiency of a marketing campaign, allowing you to understand the structure of who is influencing who, where the hubs of the network are (influential nodes with many connections), and how information flows between members of the social network.</p>
<p>In this blog post I will be coding a tool that reveals the social network structure from transactional data, requiring only a unique identifier for each individual, and a timestamp and quantity for each transaction. We will generate an undirected graph from these 3 pieces of information, with each vertex representing a person in the network. The absence of an edge between two vertices means that the transactional behavior of the corresponding individuals is conditionally independent.</p>
<p>The graphical lasso is a method that generates a large sparse matrix with edges representing conditional dependence between nodes in the network. Although an R package (glasso) already exists the graphical lasso function in the glasso package is not scalable and applying this method with high volume data becomes intractable as the amount of data grows larger. The version of the graphical lasso that is coded below is very fast, efficient, and scalable; making it a practical choice for analyzing high volume data.</p>
<p>In addition to coding a function that performs the graphical lasso we will be simulating transactional data, allowing us to evaluate how well the graphical lasso performs and is able to identify conditional dependence between the transactors in our sample.</p>
<p>First, we are going to simulate our transactional data. To simulate data we are going to use the “huge” package. The function “huge.generator” is used to simulate “n” transactions per “d” individuals. The sample being simulated condains 1000 individuals who have transactions across 1 year (365 days) and the social network structure is a set of several clusters of individuals.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>require(huge)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Loading required package: huge</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>d &lt;- 1000
simdata = huge.generator(n=365,d=d,graph=&quot;cluster&quot;) # d individuals, 365 time points

#dependence structure between individuals is examined
simdata.in &lt;- simdata$data
colnames(simdata.in) &lt;- as.character(1:ncol(simdata.in))</code></pre>
<p>Next, we will code our function that estimates the scaled partial correlations between each of the individuals from our sample. The pieces of the function are fairly simple, ensuring minimal copying and movement of data (using pointers), and applying lasso to perform sparse regression of each individuals transactions on every other (target) individuals transactions, while controlling for the effects of other (non-target) individual’s effects.</p>

<p>The following code generates the matrix of coefficients. Although many of the generated coefficients indicate true dependence structure between individuals, some of the coefficients are false positives. The code below also removes edges that are below a threshold of a little over one standard deviation above and below the median coefficient value to reduce the likelihood of including false positives. The first image produced by the code below shows the raw coefficient matrix, while the second shows our histogram used for thresholding, and finally we see the proximity matrix of the graph. In both the matrix of coefficients and the graph the cluster structure of our network is clearly visible along the diagonal.</p>
